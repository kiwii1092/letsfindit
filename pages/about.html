<h1 style="text-align: center;">About Us</h1>

<p>Welcome to the <strong>Lost and Found Information System</strong> — a platform built to reunite people with their misplaced or forgotten belongings. Whether it's a lost ID card, a forgotten bag, or a valuable item left behind, our system is designed to help individuals post, search, and recover lost items quickly and efficiently.</p>

<p>Our website empowers users to report both lost and found items, browse through existing reports, and communicate securely to return items to their rightful owners. With a user-friendly interface and powerful search tools, we ensure that every report counts and every lead can make a difference.</p>

<p>We believe that a small act of kindness — like reporting a found item — can restore someone’s day. Through community participation and a shared sense of responsibility, we aim to make campuses, cities, and communities safer and more honest places.</p>
