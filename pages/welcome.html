<h1 style="text-align: center;">Welcome to the Lost and Found Information System</h1>

<p>Have you lost something important? Or maybe you’ve found an item that doesn’t belong to you? This platform is designed to help individuals and communities reconnect lost items with their rightful owners.</p>

<p>We understand how stressful losing something can be — your student ID, phone, wallet, or a sentimental item. That’s why we’ve created a simple and effective system to report and search for lost and found items within your campus, office, or community. Our goal is to build a helpful, honest environment where people support each other through small acts of responsibility.</p>

<h2>What You Can Do Here</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Post a Lost Report:</strong> Provide a description, date, and location of the lost item.</li>
  <li><strong>Post a Found Item:</strong> Upload details and pictures of any found object so the owner can recognize and claim it.</li>
  <li><strong>Search Listings:</strong> Use filters and keywords to look through lost or found items reported by others.</li>
  <li><strong>Connect Securely:</strong> Contact the reporter or finder through a secure system to verify and claim the item.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why It Matters</h2>
<p>Every day, countless valuable items go missing — and often, they’re found but never returned because there’s no easy way to connect finders with owners. Our system bridges that gap. With just a few clicks, you can contribute to creating a more honest and cooperative community.</p>

<h2>Start Now</h2>
<p>Click on the menu above to report a lost or found item. Browse the listings or create an account to keep track of your reports. Let’s make a difference — one item at a time.</p>
